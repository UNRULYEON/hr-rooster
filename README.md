# HR Rooster

![Homepage]( "Homepage")

This was a school project where I was fed up with the way Rotterdam University handled their timetables for students and teachers.

This project focuses on:

* Responsiveness on mobile
* A faster way of looking up you're timetable for today
* Improved searchability of the teachers, students and rooms

### Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
* [OData](https://www.odata.org/)
